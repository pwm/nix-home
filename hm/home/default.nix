  # home.{sessionPath,sessionVariables} are written to

  # which in turn is sourced at the top of
  #Â ~/.config/fish/config.fish
  #
  # Notes:
  #   1. The "at the top" part is important because programs like zellij
  #      rely on the PATH being set when they hook into the shell.
  #      Setting the PATH in programs.fish.interactiveShellInit would place
  #      it _after_ the zellij hook.
  #
  #   2. For now we _also_ have to set PATH in programs.fish.interactiveShellInit
  #      as sessionPath here _appends_ not _prepends_ to the PATH.
  #      This is being discussed and hopefully fixed here:
  #        https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/issues/3324
  #        https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/pull/4582/commits/0b25ac41ee
  #      Once fixed we can remove PATH from programs.fish.interactiveShellInit
